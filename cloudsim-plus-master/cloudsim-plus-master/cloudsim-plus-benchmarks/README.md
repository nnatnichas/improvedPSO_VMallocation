# CloudSim Plus Benchmarks

This module is used just internally to assess CloudSim Plus performance.
You don't need to care about it, unless you want to investigate performance issues or contribute in this manner.

It uses the [Java Microbenchmark Harness framework (JMH)](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/) to enable measuring critical methods of the 
CloudSim Plus API which have a high impact in the simulation framework performance.
