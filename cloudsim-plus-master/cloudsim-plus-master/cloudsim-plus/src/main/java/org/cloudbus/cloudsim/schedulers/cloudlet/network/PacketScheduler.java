/**
 * Provides the functionalities to enable a {@link CloudletScheduler} to
 * send {@link VmPacket}s from the {@link Vm} of the scheduler to other ones or
 * to receive {@link VmPacket}s sent from other VMs to that {@link Vm}.
 * The packet dispatching is performed by processing {@link CloudletTask}s
 * inside a {@link NetworkCloudlet}.
 *
 * <p>A researcher creating its own simulations using CloudSim Plus usually doesn't have to
 * care about this class, since even creating network-enabled simulations using objects
 * such as {@link NetworkDatacenter}, {@link NetworkHost}, {@link NetworkVm}
 * and {@link NetworkCloudlet}, the {@link NetworkHost} will automatically create and instance of
 * the current interface and attach them to the {@link CloudletScheduler}
 * that every Vm is using, doesn't matter what kind of scheduler it is.</p>
