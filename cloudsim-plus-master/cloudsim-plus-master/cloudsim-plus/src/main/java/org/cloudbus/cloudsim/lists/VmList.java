     * with the same ID and the need to find VMs by its id and user id, as in
     * the method {@link #getByIdAndUserId(java.util.List, int, int)}. The first
     * concern could be dealt by ensuring that all VMs have different ID (in
     * fact, I don't know if VM id uniqueness is a CloudSim requirement) and
     * creating a map by VM id. The second concern could be dealt by creating a
     * Map<UserID, List<VmIDs>>. The third concern is, that changing the
     * class of these lists may have a potential effect on the entire project
     * and in the creation of simulations that has to be priorly assessed.
