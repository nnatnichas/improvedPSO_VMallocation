/**
 * Provides {@link org.cloudbus.cloudsim.selectionpolicies.power.PowerVmSelectionPolicy}
 * implementations that define policies to be used by a {@link org.cloudbus.cloudsim.hosts.Host}
 * to select a {@link org.cloudbus.cloudsim.vms.Vm} to migrate from a list of VMs.
 *
 * <p>The order in which VMs are migrated may impact positive or negatively
 * some SLA metric. For instance, migrating VMs that are requiring more bandwidth
 * may reduce network congestion after such VMs are migrated and
 * will make more bandwidth available that will reduce the migration
 * time for subsequent migrating VMs.</p>
